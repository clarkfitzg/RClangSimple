\Abstract{ 

The ability to get information about \C/\Cpp{} code routines and data
structures can allow us to do many things in an intrepreted language
such as \R.  We use \libclang{}, a flexible, embeddable library, to
develop \R{} functionality to obtain and use information about native
code.  We describe the \Rpkg{RCIndex} package which provides
high-level functionality to access and utilize this information and
also lower-level approaches to query and manipulate other aspects of
native source code.  We describe how to use the package and scenarios in
which it is useful.  This functionality is infrastructural and some of
the functionality of the package is the native code analogy to the
\Rpkg{codetools} package for \R{} code.  It is not necessarily of
direct interest to end-users, but it allows us to build numerous tools
that can help end-users and developers.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:Introduction}

We typically think of \C{} and \Cpp{} code as something we write,
compile and call. It is rarely the input to anything but the compiler.
However, such code is a source of potentially useful information that
we can exploit in statistical and scientific computing.  In order to
leverage this information, we need to be able to access it in a
structured manner and in a form that we can compute on and in the
programming environment in which we want to use it.
\libclang{}~\cite{bib:libclang}, \cite{bib:libclangSlides} has
emerged as a powerful, industrial-strength library that provides
valuable functionality for working with \C/\Cpp{} source code and that
we can embed in \R{} (and many other languages).

There are several applications of being able to programmatically
understand \C/\Cpp{} code in a high-level language such as \R.

\textbf{Registering \R-callable routines}: When we write \C/\Cpp{}
code to use in an \R{} package, it is useful to explicitly register
the routines that we can call via any of the
\Rfunc{.C}/\Rfunc{.Call}/\Rfunc{.External} interfaces.  When the
routines are registered, \R{} can help to identify potential errors in
calling them.  \R{} can detect an incorrect number of arguments for a
routine, or that the types are incorrect, e.g. an integer vector when
a numeric vector is expected. Registration also allows us to resolve
the symbols just once rather than each time we call a routine, and it
also allows us to use different symbols to refer to the routines.  It
is convenient to be able to run \R{} code to identify the \R-callable
routines and to generate the registration information
programmatically.  As we change these routines, we can programatically
update the registration information with little effort and ensure the
information is synchronized.


\textbf{Generating bindings to native libraries}: Numerous \R{}
packages provide interfaces to existing \C/\Cpp{} libraries.  This
typically involves manually creating two pieces of code. The first is
an \R-callable wrapper routine corresponding to each routine of
interest in the third-party library. The second is a corresponding
\R{} function that invokes the wrapper routine, having coerced the
\R{} arguments to the appropriate form.  This is often quite
straightforward, but both time-consuming and error-prone.  This makes
for unnecessarily lengthy write-debug-test cycles.  Instead, we'd like
to be able to programmatically read the information about the
third-party routines and data types and then generate all of the code.
We want to minimize human intervention.  If we could generate these
``bindings'' programmatically, the \R{} programmer can spend time
creating higher-level functionality using these primitives.

\textbf{Dynamic calls to native routines}: The
\Rpkg{rdyncall}~\cite{bib:rdyncall} and \Rpkg{Rffi}~\cite{bib:Rffi}
\R{} packages avoid having to explicitly create the wrapper routines
and \R{} functions to interface to existing \C{} routines. Instead,
they both provide a dynamic mechanism to call arbitrary native
routines.  However, both approaches require a description of the
target routines.  Again, we want to obtain this information
programmatically and then we can easily generate these descriptions
and remove humans from the process.

\textbf{Understanding third-party libraries interactively}: When we
interface to third-party libraries, we typically read documentation to
identify and understand the important routines and data structures.
In some situations, it can be convenient to find this information
interactively within an environment such as \R.  Rather than reading
static document, we can query the code for information such as how
often a particular data type is returned by a routine or passed as an
argument? or what idioms does the library use?  We can use \R's
graphics capabilities to visualize the code and which routines call
which other routines.

%documentation in comments - see RCUDA.
\textbf{In-line documentation as comments}: Often third-party native
libraries contain documentation in comments adjacent to the corresponding
routines and data structures.  Accordingly, it is convenient to be able to easily
access this documentation and potentially reuse it as \R{}
documentation for functions that interface to the routines, as we did
for the \Rpkg{RCUDA} package (\url{http://github.com/duncantl/RCUDA}).

\textbf{Compiling \R{} code}: Recently, we have been developing \R{}
facilities for compiling \R{} code to native instructions to by-pass
the \R{} interpreter.  This allows us to rewrite and translate \R{}
code so that it is essentially native code and can call other existing
native routines, for example, in the \R{} engine or standard \C{}
libraries.  This results in significant speedup.  However, to make
this work, we need to know the signature -- parameter types and return
type -- of these native, external routines.  Again, if we can find
this information programmatically, we greatly simplify and improve the
entire process of generating the code.

\textbf{Determining memory management and mutability of inputs and
  outputs}: When we call existing native routines, we often want need
to know whether we are in charge of the memory for the inputs or
whether the called routine is responsible.  Often, programmers omit
important information about whether a parameter is modified within a
routine or if it is constant.  This is important information as it
allows us to differentiate between an array of values passed as a
pointer, or a scalar whose contents are changed.  We would like to be
able to analyze the body of the routine to be able to determine if and
how it modifies its parameters so that we can avoid making copies of
data, if possible.


\textbf{Software as Data}: While we may not think of code as data,
analyzing software is an important field of research and industry.
Software defines several networks related to i) which routines call
which other routines, ii) the hierarchical structure of \Cpp{}
classes, iii) which files \texttt{\#include} other files, and so on.
We can explore how these networks change over time, i.e. modifications
to the code. We can find which global/non-local variables are used in
which routines to help identify problems with parallelization and
potential refactorzation of the code.  We can combine this data with
version control history to better understand software projects.


\textbf{Detecting errors in native code for \R}: \R's package
mechanism provides a powerful set of tests and checks for potential
errors in \R{} code.  These are very useful and can identify errors
such as misspelled variable or function names before the code is run.
It would be valuable to perform similar tests on \C{} code in \R{}
packages.  We might identify common issues such as not protecting
allocated \R{} objects from garbage collection.  We could do this by
analyzing uses of \Cfunc{PROTECT} and \Cfunc{UNPROTECT} calls and
ensuring there is an appropriate correspondence.  These are
\R-specific checks and will not be done by other code-analyzing
software.


We can also find ``dead'' routines that are never called by other
routines and so help to reduce the code.

We hope these applications motivate the utility of being able to
navigate native code in \R and indicate that there are many more.  In
this paper, we describe how to use the \R{} interface to \libclang to
find this kind of information needed in these types applications.  We
start next by describing the fundamental concepts of \libclang{} in
section~\ref{sec:libclangConcepts}.  We follow this in
section~\ref{sec:RCIndex} by introducing the high-level functionality
provided by the \Rpkg{RCIndex} package, e.g. getting the routines,
data structures, \Cpp{} classes in a source file.  We then discuss the
lower-level functionality in the package on which these higher-level
functions are based in section~\ref{sec:BuildingBlocks}.  We explore
three reasonably comprehensive examples or case-studies in
section~\ref{sec:Examples} and then compare this approach with others
that I and others have pursued in the past.  Finally, we outline some
future plans for the package and its use.




% This could come after the high-level material, but it may make sense here.
\input{clangConcepts}

\section[The RCIndex package]{The \Rpkg{RCIndex} package}\label{sec:RCIndex}
The \Rpkg{RCIndex} provides numerous high-level functions that return
information about \C{} code.  These refer to functions that I have
developed building on the lower-level tools and which users can call
to get useful information directly or to perform high-level tasks such
as generating registration information or getting all the routines or
\Cpp{} classes in a source file. These might be initial steps in a
higher-level task, but these are high-level relative to the primitive
functions in the \Rpkg{RCIndex} package with which we implemented
these functions.

\subsection{High-level Functionality}

% Talk about filtering based on the file name. (Implement this
% consistently).  Mention can do it afterwords or during the collection.

We might consider functions that take a source file and extract one or
more of the types of top-level elements in that file, e.g. routines,
data structures, enumeration definitions, \Cpp{} class definitions as
the very highest-level functions.  The \R{} user can call these
functions with just the name of the file and perhaps additional
arguments for the parser and the results are returned.  The user
doesn't have to write any code to manipulate or traverse the parse
tree (AST).  She doesn't have to necessarily create a translation unit
before calling one of these functions. As such, they are ``atomic''.
These functions can also take an existing, previously parsed,
translation unit rather than the file name.  This is useful if we are
going to make multiple separate queries of the same source code,
i.e. we parse it once and query it multiple time.

The following paragraphs describe many of the high-level functions in
the \Rpkg{RCIndex} package.

\paragraph{Finding routines}
The \Rfunc{getRoutines} does as its name suggests. It takes a file
name or an existing translation unit object and returns a list with an
element for each routine declaration or definition in the
corresponding code.  Each element contains the \Rclass{CXCursor}
object representing the routine, a list of the parameters giving their
name and data types, and the return type.  This is an S4
object of class \Rclass{FunctionDecl}. Since this contains the cursor,
we can query it for the name of the routine, the file in which it is
located, the location in that file and so on. In other words,
information that we don't explicitly collect into the \R{} object can
be determined later when we use this description of the routine.
%?Show example?

\paragraph{Data type definitions}
The routines are typically our focus so that we can invoke them from
\R{} or analyze their code. However, the routines work on data types
and therefore we need to be able to find the definitions of these data
types.  The \Rfunc{getDataStructures} function returns a list of the
data types defined in a translation unit corresponding to a source
file.  These include \Ckeyword{struct} and \Ckeyword{union}
definitions, \Ckeyword{typedef}s for providing an alternative name for
an existing type and enumerated constant definitions.

\paragraph{\Cpp{} class definitions}
For \Cpp{} code, we can use \Rfunc{getCppClasses} to traverse a
translation unit, either pre-parsed or a source file, and construct a
description for each of the \Cpp{} classes it contains. Each class
description is an instance of the class \Rclass{C++Class}, with
template classes using the derived class \Rclass{TemplateC++Class}.  A
class description contains the name of the class, a list of its fields
and another for its methods, and references to the base/super class
cursors.  The fields and methods each have their type information and
also the accessor qualifier, i.e. \Cppkeyword{private},
\Cppkeyword{protected} or \Cppkeyword{public}.  It is relatively
straightforward to generate \Cpp{} code from this description that
defines a new derived sub-class whose methods we can implement with \R{}
functions.  We can then provide \R{} instances of that class that
operate transparently as regular \Cpp{} objects.


\paragraph{Enumerated constant definitions}
\Rfunc{getEnums} returns a list of the enumeration definitions in a
source file, i.e. corresponding to an expression of the form
\Cexpr{enum \{ A, B, C\}}. Each element is an instance of the S4 class
\Rclass{EnumerationDefinition}.  Like the \Rclass{FunctionDecl} class,
this contains a reference to the definition in case we want to query
it further at a later time.  The actual values in the enumeration are
stored in the \Rslot{values} slot as a named integer vector.  The
names are the symbolic names we should use, while the values are the
literal values to which these names correspond.  These values allow us
to cross the interface between \R{} and native code where there is no
existing association between the symbolic names.

\paragraph{Global Variables}
The \Rfunc{getGlobalVariables} function returns information about all
of the top-level/non-local variables within a source file.  From this, we have
their names and types, and can also determine if they are constant,
and if they are local to this file (i.e. \Ckeyword{static}) or
accessible to routines in other files.  We may be interested in global
variables for various reasons.  We can use either of the
\Rpkg{rdyncall} or \Rpkg{Rffi} packages to dynamically access the
current value of a global variable.  We also want to remove global
variables when making code thread-safe or just for improving the logic
of the code, i.e. avoiding side-effects.

The function \Rfunc{findGlobals} finds global variables that are used
within a routine or entire translation unit.  The function is
intentionally analogous to the \Rfunc{findGlobals} function in
\Rpkg{codetools}~\cite{bib:codetools}. It returns the variables, and
optionally, the routines that are called, within a routine/translation
unit which are not locally defined as parameters or local variables.


\paragraph{Find calls to routines}
The \Rfunc{findCalls} function takes a cursor -- typically either a
routine or an entire translation unit -- and finds the names of
routines in any call made within this code.  This allows us to
determine which routines call which other routines and so describe a
graph/network.  We can then discover potentially interesting things
about the routines.  For example, we might look at just the routines
within a single file and see which of these call other routines in the
file and which are called by other routines in the file.  This might
identify isolated routines that don't necessarily belong in this
particular file. It might also help us to understand how the the
routines interact and cluster.  We can use the \Rpkg{igraph}~\cite{bib:igraph} and/or
\Rpkg{graph}~\cite{bib:graphPkg} packages to perform computations on the network and also
to visualize it.

We'll show how to do this on a file \file{memory.c} in the \R{}
interpreter's source.
We start by obtaining the routines from the file:
\begin{RCode}
f = sprintf("%s/../src/main/memory.c", R.home())
r = getRoutines(f, args = "-DHAVE_CONFIG_H",
                  includes = c(sprintf("%s/../src/include", R.home()),
                               sprintf("%s/include", R.home())))
\end{RCode}
We'll discuss the extra arguments \Rarg{args} and \Rarg{includes} in section~\ref{sec:BuildingBlocks}.

For each of these routines, we find which routines they call with
\begin{RCode}
kalls = lapply(r, findCalls)
\end{RCode}
To restrict the routines to only those within this file
and create the adjacency matrix, we use 
\begin{RCode}
withinFileCalls = lapply(kalls, intersect, names(r))    
m = matrix(0, length(r), length(r), dimnames = list(names(r), names(r)))
invisible(sapply(names(withinFileCalls), 
           function(id) 
              m[id,  withinFileCalls[[id]]] <<- 1))
\end{RCode}
We'll discard the routines that are not called by any other routine
and themselves do not call any routine in the file. We do this with
\begin{RCode}
i = rowSums(m) == 0 & colSums(m) == 0
m = m[!i, !i]  
\end{RCode}
These are all basic \R{} manipulations of \R{} objects and have
nothing to do with \libclang.

% We could do this more elegantly.
Finally, we can draw the graph
\begin{RCode}
library(igraph)
g = graph.adjacency(mm, "directed")       
plot(g, vertex.size = 2, vertex.label.cex = .6, edge.arrow.size = .5)
\end{RCode}
and it is displayed in figure~\ref{fig:callgraph}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=.9\textheight]{callgraph.pdf}
\caption{A display of the call graph for the file \file{memory.c} in
  \R's source. This displays which routines call which other routines
  within that file alone. The clusters and important routines become evident.}
  \label{fig:callgraph}
\end{figure}

I often use the \Rpkg{findCalls} function when creating bindings to
third-party libraries to determine which routines currently have no
wrapper routine.


%\subsection[Registering R-callable routines]{Registering \R-callable routines}
\paragraph{Registering \R-callable routines}
We mentioned in section~\ref{sec:Introduction} registering native
routines we can call from \R{} via the \Rfunc{.C}, \Rfunc{.Call} and
\Rfunc{.External} interfaces.
The registration information is \C{} code that looks something like
\begin{CCode}
static R_CallMethodDef CallEntries[] = {
     {"R_csv_sample", (DL_FUNC) &R_csv_sample, 2},
     {NULL, NULL, 0}
};

void attribute_visible R_init_FastCSVSample(DllInfo *dll)
{
   R_registerRoutines(dll, NULL, CallEntries, NULL, NULL);
   R_useDynamicSymbols(dll, TRUE);
}  
\end{CCode}
This example comes is generated from the \Rpkg{FastCSVSample} package
(\url{http://github.com/duncantl/FastCSVSample}). In this case, there
is only one \C{} routine we invoke via the \Rfunc{.Call}.  In the
\Rpkg{stats} package, there are $83$ \Rfunc{.Call} and $10$ \Rfunc{.C}
routines, with registration information for all. 

It is tedious, and hence error-prone, to manually create this
registration information, and also to update it as the code evolves.
Instead, we can use the \Rfunc{createRegistrationCode} function to
generate it for us.  This is often as simple as something like
\begin{RCode}
rg = createRegistrationCode("~/GitWorkingArea/FastCSVSample/src")  
cat("#include <R_ext/Rdynload.h>",  rg, sep = "\n", file = "init.c")
\end{RCode}
For an \R{} package, we specify the \dir{src} directory of that
package.  We can also provide arguments for the parser such as
\Rarg{includes} or pre-processor definitions via the \Rarg{args} parameter
using \Rfunc{createRegistrationCode}'s \Rarg{\dots} parameter.  The function processes each \C{} and \Cpp{}
file in the directory and determines which routines can be called via
the \Rfunc{.C} interface and which can be called by \Rfunc{.Call}.  It
does this by examining the signatures and determining which are
consistent with the different call mechanism.  It then creates the
registration information and also generates the \Cfunc{R_init_...}
routine, using the name of the package as suffix.

The \R{} registration mechanism doesn't currently permit the
programmer to specify which type of \R{} object is expected for each
parameter in a \Rfunc{.Call} routine, e.g. an integer or numeric
vector, or a function or a list.  The \Rpkg{RCIndex} functionality
does, however, allow us to infer this by analyzing the code within a
routine and determining how it is being accessed.  This could be added
to the registration information and allow \R{} to perform run-time
checks or coercion to the appropriate types in call to the routine.


\paragraph{Listing included files}
The function \Rfunc{getInclusions} allows us to obtain a list of all
the files included in our translation unit, both directly and
indirectly.  This allows us to find what files include other files,
what are included by multiple files, what files are not included in a
directory and so on. We can also visualize the implicit network.


\subsection{Low-level building blocks}\label{sec:BuildingBlocks}

The functions we described above do not require the user to know any
of the details of \libclang{} and how \Rpkg{RCIndex} extracts the
information from a source code file.  To work with the results of some
of these functions, however, the \R{} programmer may need to know a
little about \libclang's type system. Furthermore, to go beyond these
functions and extract different information, a programmer needs to
understand the lower-level tools on which these functions were built.
At the very least, it is useful to know how to create a translation
unit directly rather than re-parsing the same file multiple times.  In
this section, we discuss the functionality for creating a translation
unit, working with cursor objects and cursor hierarchies.  We'll
address writing visitor functions after these topics.



\paragraph{Creating a translation unit} 
One of the two vital functions in \Rpkg{RCIndex} is \Rfunc{createTU}.
This takes the name of a source file and parses it into a translation
unit object in memory, returning a reference to that as an opaque \R{}
object.
The signature of the function is 
\begin{RCode}
createTU(src, includes = character(), 
         idx = createIndex(verbose = verbose), 
         args = character(), 
         verbose = getOption("ShowParserDiagnostics", TRUE), options = 0)   
\end{RCode}
The \Rarg{includes} parameter allows us to specify one or more paths
to directories in which to find \Ckeyword{\#include}'d header files. We
can pass arguments to control the parser via the \Rvar{args}
parameter. These can be pre-processor flags and definitions such as
\verb+-DHAVE_CONFIG_H+, or any of the options the \libclang{} parser
understands such as \texttt{-ferror-limit=1000} % \libclangFlag{-ferror-limit=1000} 
and
\mbox{\texttt{-fparse-all-comments}}. % \libclangFlag{-fparse-all-comments}.
The entire set of options is documented in
the \clang{} user manual
(\url{http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html})\footnote{The code
  generation options are not relevant as we are not generating code,
  only parsing it.}.

\Rfunc{createTU}'s \Rarg{options} parameter allows us specify certain additional
control options for creating the parser beyond the \Rarg{args} parameter.  These control
aspects such as skipping the bodies of routines when we just want the
declarations, keeping a more complete record of the pre-processing
steps, and other aspects that don't concern us.
We specify these options either as a combination of
bitwise-enumeration values from the \Rvar{CXTranslationUnit_Flags}
class.
For instance, to skip the body of the routines and to indicate the 
translation unit is incomplete, we can use
\begin{RCode}
CXTranslationUnit_SkipFunctionBodies | CXTranslationUnit_Incomplete  
\end{RCode}
These two \R{} variables represent these two options and we are
combining them via the \Rop{|} operator.
An alternative, but equivalent,  approach is to use short-hand names as a character
vector, e.g.
\begin{RCode}
c("SkipFunctionBdies", "Incomplete")
\end{RCode}

The \Rarg{index} parameter for the \Rfunc{createTU} function is often
omitted as we typically parse a single source file and work on it
separately from others.  However, as we mentioned, routines often
refer to other routines or variables in other source files in the same
project.  The index is a container for related translation units and
provides the mechanism for resolving references across translation
units it manages.  Therefore, if we want to work on multiple related
source files, we should first create an index and then pass this to
each call to \Rfunc{createTU}, e.g.
\begin{RCode}
index = createIndex()
tus = lapply(list.files("src", pattern = "\\.c$", full.names = TRUE),
               createTU, index = index)
\end{RCode}
%$
Alternatively, we can pass a vector of file names in the call to
\Rfunc{createTU} and it will create a translation unit for each, using
the same index and \Rarg{args} and \Rarg{includes}. So our example
could be  written as 
\begin{RCode}
tus = createTU(list.files("src", pattern = "\\.c$", full.names = TRUE))  
\end{RCode}
%$

When creating an index, we can control whether it displays errors,
warnings and general diagnostic information about the code on the
console.  We can disable this via the \Rarg{verbose} parameter and
passing \Rfalse{} as its value.

\paragraph{Working with cursors}
A translation unit is a container for the parse tree.
We can query the name of the source file  with
\Rfunc{getFileName}. More importantly, we can 
access the root cursor in a translation unit
with either of the following expressions
\begin{RCode}
as(tu, "CXCursor")
getTranslationUnitCursor(tu)
\end{RCode}
A cursor in \R{} has the class \Rclass{CXCursor}.

A cursor is a representation  of a general semantic concept such
as a call expression, a binary operation, a variable declaration and
so on.  We find out its particular kind or purpose using
the \Rfunc{getCursorKind}  function or the short-hand
\Rdollar{} operator. So the following are equivalent
\begin{RCode}
  getCursorKind(cur)
  cur$kind
\end{RCode}
%$

Most cursors have an associated string such as the name of the routine
being invoked in a call expression or a variable being referenced in a
variable declaration.  We get this string via the \Rfunc{getName} function.

We can retrieve the actual text from the source file associated with a
cursor using \Rfunc{getCursorTokens}. This is important in some cases
when the kind of the cursor doesn't give us enough detail to
disambiguate between various possibilities.  For example, a binary
operator doesn't tell us what operator was being used.  For this, we
look at the actual text. \Rfunc{getCursorTokens} conveniently returns
the associated source code text already broken into lexical tokens
with names that identify their token types, e.g. \dquote{Punctuation}.

If we parse the code using the \verb+-fparse-all-comments+ argument to
\Rfunc{createTU}, we can retrieve the comments associated with certain
kinds of cursors, i.e. variable, routine and type declarations.  There
are several functions to access the comment.  We can get the text with
\Rfunc{getRawCommentText}. We can also get a brief version of the
comment corresponding to certain conventions for marking up
documentation in comments via \Rfunc{getBriefComment}, i.e.  the text
to the end of the line after a \verb+\brief+ directive in the comment.  The
\Rfunc{getParsedComment} function returns an actual \Rclass{CXComment} object
and we can treat this as a hierarchical object with child comments.

In some situations, it is important to map a cursor to its location in
the source file. \Rfunc{getLocation} returns the filename and the line
and column numbers and the number of bytes (or offset) from the start
of the file. \libclang{} has various concepts of location and we can
express which one we want to use by name, i.e. one of
\dquote{Expansion}, \dquote{Instantiation} and \dquote{Presumed}.

Some kinds of cursors are references to other elements in the
translation unit. For example, in a call expression, the routine being
called is represented by a reference cursor that refers to the actual
routine. We can resolve that reference with the
\Rfunc{getCursorReferenced} function.

Recall that cursors are recursive structures, often with child cursors.  We
typically write functions that traverse this tree using
\Rfunc{visitCursor} and we will discuss this in the next section.
However, it is convenient at times to explicitly access a cursor's
children, and their children and so on.  We can conceptually think of the
cursor as being like an \R{} list with the children as its
elements. This allows us to access the children individually using
\Rexpr{cur[[i]]}, where \Rvar{i} is the index of the child ( with the
first child at index 1). We can't use names to index the children or
the \Rdollar{} operator. We can find the number of children a
cursor has using the \Rfunc{length} function.  We can access the entire list of
children explicitly by calling the \Rfunc{children} function and this allows us to loop
over them with \Rfunc{lapply} or \Rfunc{sapply}.

In addition to being able to descend the cursor tree, we can navigate
up the hierarchy using \Rfunc{getCursorSemanticParent} and in a
slightly different sense of the hierarchy with \Rfunc{getCursorLexicalParent}.


\paragraph{Traversing a cursor tree}
To traverse a cursor tree, we typically use the \Rfunc{visitCursor} function.
This is (currently) more efficient than recursively processing the
entire tree with \R{} code looping over the children. However, writing
visitor functions can be complicated as it typically involves
maintaining state across calls to the same function. This is not very
common in \R{} so needs some discussion.

\section{Extended Examples and Applications}\label{sec:Examples}
In this section, we explore some more advanced examples of how to use
the \Rpkg{RCIndex} package to get different information from a
translation unit.  One of the best sources of such examples is the set
of high-level functions in the package itself,
e.g. \Rfunc{getRoutines}, \Rfunc{getCppClasses}.  In the package and
in the example in this section, we have used the generator function
and lexical scoping approach to implement a set of collector functions
that gather the different types of information we want.

In section~\ref{sec:Introduction}, we provided numerous motivating
applications of being able to process native code.  We will present
partial/heuristic approaches to some of these.  One aim of these
examples is to illustrate how to traverse the translation unit and
sub-cursors and work on the structure of the information.  Another aim
is to illustrate how to work with \libclang's type system.

These examples have been more involved than many tasks we might want
to do with \Rpkg{RCIndex} but they show what is possible.

\section{Future Work}

We have created bindings for most of the facilities provided by
\libclang.  However, we have ignored the code-completion routines and
the various indexing facilities.  Now that we have the basic tools
provided by \Rpkg{RCIndex} in \R, we can programmatically generate
bindings to these routines. 

Many of the bindings for \Rpkg{RCIndex} were generated
programmatically. Accordingly, there is little documentation for
these. We plan to adapt the documentation from the source code
to provide more direct documentation in \R.

The package provides a reasonably involved way to garbage collect the
common \C{} data types from \libclang{} used in \R,
i.e. \Ctype{CXCursor} and \Ctype{CXTranslationUnit}.  This is
complicated as there is a dependency between these types as a
\Ctype{CXTranslationUnit} object cannot be released when it is no
longer directly referenced in \R. This is because there may be
\Ctype{CXCursor} objects it contains still referenced by \R.  We hope
to extend this mechanism to \Ctype{CXType} and \Ctype{CXIndex}.

Given these basic bindings, we plan to develop additional high-level
functionality to process different aspects of native code. We are
interested in processing the bodies of the routines to understand
their characteristics.  We also plan to extend the \R{} code to
generate bindings to routines and data structures.  This code is
currently in a sub-directory of the package (\dir{generateCode}) and
so not directly exposed to \R{} users.  We also used this to generate
many of the bindings for the \Rpkg{RCUDA} package
(\url{http://github.com/duncantl/RCUDA}). We will merge the code
generation mechanisms from the previous work on
\Rpkg{RGCCTranslationUnit} and SWIG.


Over the last decade, some of us have considered making the \R{}
source code thread-safe and introduce user-level threads.  While there
are many reasons, both technical and non-technical, why this hasn't been
done, it would be easier to do with tools that analyze the source code
and identify where and how the code needs to change.  While we don't
have to develop these tools in \R{} itself, it is convenient and
\Rpkg{RCIndex} can be useful for developing such re-factoring tools.

While not exclusively related to \Rpkg{RCIndex}, we are experimenting
with ways to compile aspects of the \R{} language and \R{} code to
native machine code.  We can then compile \R{} visitor functions to make
them significantly faster.  Not coincidentally, the compilation uses
\llvm{} as the code generator and \llvm{} is the back-end for \clang{},
the \C/\Cpp{} compiler from which \libclang{} came.


While these are tasks that I think might be useful and I may work on,
I welcome others to develop any of them separately, contribute and/or
collaborate with me, or fork the package.
