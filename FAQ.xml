<p>What does my visitor function have to return?
<a>It  should return a value of class CXChildVisit.
This is an enumeration. 
It allows to terminate the traversal, traverse across the siblings and skip
the childre, or to traverse the children recursively.
Instead of a value of this enumeration type, you can return a logical value.
If this is <r:true/>, we continue recursively. If this is <r:false/>, we end the traversal.
If the function returns anything other than a logical, integer or numeric, 
we just asume CXChildVisit_Recurse and so continue to traverse the children recursively.
