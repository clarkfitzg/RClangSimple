<p>How do I install libclang?</p>
<a>
<p>
You can use a package manager.
See <ulink url="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17657261/how-to-install-clang-pre-built-binaries-ubuntu-12-04"/>.
You can install from source by following the instructions at
<ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/llvm.html"/>.

<p>What does my visitor function have to return?</p>
<a>It  should return a value of class CXChildVisit.
This is an enumeration. 
It allows to terminate the traversal, traverse across the siblings and skip
the childre, or to traverse the children recursively.
Instead of a value of this enumeration type, you can return a logical value.
If this is <r:true/>, we continue recursively. If this is <r:false/>, we end the traversal.
If the function returns anything other than a logical, integer or numeric, 
we just asume CXChildVisit_Recurse and so continue to traverse the children recursively.

What are good sources of documentation for libclang and how to work with the data types
expose by <omg:pkg>RCIndex</omg:pkg>?
