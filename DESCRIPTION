Title: Interface to the clang parser's C API
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
SystemRequirements: clang 
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu>
Description: This package is currently an interface to some of the
    functionality in the clang parsing facilities.
    The idea is to be able to extract information from C and C++
    source files and headers so that we can do semantic analysis
    on the contents and use this information in various different
    ways. One application is to be able to programmatically generate
    bindings to arbitrary C/C++ routines.  The functionality here
    is similar to the basic facilities in RGCCTranslationUnit.
    We will probably develop a richer and more powerful interface 
    using the C++ API that will give us access to all of the AST
    classes.
