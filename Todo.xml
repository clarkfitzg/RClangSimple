Allow caller to provide mutiple files or multiple translation units
and process them together.
createTU can return them all using a single index.
Don't seem to be able to get translation units from an index, i.e. query an index for how many and specific TUs.

S4 class for FunctionDecl. Extend NativeElement.

function to reparse a TU.

<item>
Allow us to set our own types that mimic the libclang types, i.e. classes
that have the same methods.
This would allow us to change the parameters and return types in routines,
e.g. set the returnType on a FunctionDecl, e.g. isConstQualifiedType
</item>


<item>
Make the structs and data types more accessible with 
R-like operators on fields to get, e.g. line numbers, etc.
</item>



<item>
Show how to read C code and find references to global variables
in the bodies of routines.
Does clang allow us to resolve the variable there and then,
i.e. find the actual CXCursor for the global variable.
<br/>
<r:code>
parseTU("inst/exampleCode/globalUse.c")
</r:code>
shows cursors of kind DeclRefExpr.
So let's explore those:

Speed of, e.g., getFunctions, slowed down by match and S4 classes.
match may be from filtering file names.

Allow post-processing the return value from the .Call(), e.g. 
getFileTime() and make it a POSIXct.  (See cuda.R example.)
Want to do it programmatically.

<item>
Differentiate between data types for structures
and their corresponding  types.

Implement interface to add/combine  TUs  for different files.

We create an index and then reuse that.

Function to combine collectors so that they all get called in a single

Borrow the CRoutine and RFunction classes from RGCCTU and code for pretty printing
code.
Currently source()'ing the code from ~/GitWorkingArea/RGCCTranslationUnit/R/codeObjects.R
That's all we need. 
Have to figure out how to synchronize the two versions.
</item>

<item>
Add bindings for the different relevant methods
</item>



<item>
Add features that are in RGCCTU for code generation.
.copy, options to se finalizers when we create instances or return them, 
accessors for struct fields, 
</item>

<item>
Add finalizers to the types CXType, CXCursor, etc.
and garbage collect them properly.

Fill in the other routines of the API using RGCCTU.

Either tell RGCCTU what name to use, or change the existing code!

We have enough of libclang to generate these using libclang and RCIndex.

Getting the name of a type doesn't seem to be working anymore.
See tests/fib.R.
Is this  just for basic types?
<r:code>
 getTypeKind(fib$returnType) == CXType_Int

<item>
Add finalizers, e.g. disposeTranslationUnit
Have to worry about holding elements belonging to it, e.g. cursors.

Why aren't we seeing comment nodes.
<br/>
Only see the doxygen comments by default.
If we want all the comments, use the argument "-fparse-all-comments" when creating the TU.
Then the comments appear, not as their own cursor kind, but attched to certain cursors.
(Found this by grepping for Comment in the clang/docs/ directory in llvm-devel.

<item status="done">
Explanation: not cloning the cursors.
aborting in visitor. See explorations/protect.R
Could it be anything to do with the cursors and not copying them deeply?
No, it has to do with releasing the TU.
Can we get the TU from a CXCursor? If so, could use an external
table to keep references counts.
Reading the source code ~/llvm-devel/tools/clang/tools/libclang/,
it appears we can get this information from the data, in data[2].
